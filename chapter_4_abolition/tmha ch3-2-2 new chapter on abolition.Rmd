The British Abolition of Slavery in 1833, alongside the abolition of the slave trade by British naval vessels in 1806, were once celebrated as the sign that Britain was a nation committed to moral progress around the world. That claim has been significantly modified by historical research in recent years, as researchers have underscored that the abolition of slavery failed to end many forms of slavery; it wooed slave owners through instituting a prolonged form of slavery called "apprenticeships." In India and the rest of Asia, slavery meanwhile persisted unreformed. 

Studying the interplay between white male politicians as they debated the fate of millions of enslaved persons from the West Indies to South Africa is in many ways an out-of-date exercise. Today, we recognize the degree to which enslaved people across British empire struggled to liberate themselves. A persistent tradition of uprisings and riots marked their ongoing resistance. The life of ideas and leaders — even women leaders like Queen Nannie — are important to this story.  

We will find only an indirect trace of how the freedom struggles of the Caribbean changed laws and ideas in Britain. The personages and uprisings that rocked the West Indies were rarely named in Westminster. The direct records of those events are held in pamphlets and documents in the Caribbean itself, slowly being digitalized through other means. 

And yet, those freedom struggles half a world a way did matter in many respects to British life. They circulated among evangelical readers; they forced philosophers of capitalism to reckon with the way that capitalism had been instantiated as misery in many places where it was enacted. British debates about slavery came to a head in the halls of parliament after 1832, when an evangelical middle class got the vote after decades of political struggles of their own. In 1833, the elected representatives of the evangelical middle class committed themselves to talking about slavery as a moral ill and bringing it to an end across empire. 

One question that might allow us to unpack the impact of abolition is how British understandings of empire and capitalism were changed in the course of those debates — in a year when both parliament and the newspapers were filled with a detailed discussion of the suffering caused by the slave system.  One way of approaching the question of what happened in 1833 is to look for the ideas that were up for debate. Were any of the fundamental concepts of the enlightenment challenged or redefined in the course of these arguments?

# The Importance of Background Knowledge

Before we begin to think about the contribution that text mining can make to the problem, we first need to be able to summarize the understanding and debates of the historians who have studied these questions. The paragraphs above summarize some of the different perspectives on the slavery question taken by historians from the recent and more distant past. In short, we need some background knowledge. But how does an analyst get there, if they don't first have a series of prepared paragraphs to introduce them to a historical problem? 

"Background knowledge" in a subject field refers to the kind of knowledge that one acquires by reading the major textbooks and secondary monographs from the field of History that cover the historical time period in question. This is extensive knowledge about which sources have been consulted, what scholars have debated, whether the actions of kings or parliaments or working-class people mattered at this period of time and why.  

Remarks about the importance of reading background information may be experienced as off-putting by some undergraduate students of data, who want to be assured that in a course on text mining that they will acquire the tools to make wonderful discoveries.  But just as students of statistics must study more than an introductory course in statistics to make a novel contribution, so too students of text mining must enroll in more than one course to do really important work.  Reading a wikipedia entry cannot substitute for the kind of background knowledge that a student would acquire in the course of taking an introductory course on the History of Victorian England. Nor can Text Mining for Historical Analysis make up for courses in the undergraduate study of History, although this book’s companion volume, The Dangerous Art of Text Mining, includes many arguments about the specific kind of knowledge of sources, obfuscations, agency, and experience that historical study makes available.  Producing insight worthy of the attention of multiple fields is no simple game. It cannot be produced at the touch of a button or the application of a new algorithm to new data; it requires adjusting the algorithm, rethinking the questions, examining the data, and iterating through the work until something truly surprising has come to light. 

A shortcut which Guldi recommends in The Dangerous Art of Text Mining for those who want to achieve results before enrolling in a specialist course on the historical background material is to engage in an ongoing collaboration with a professor, librarian, or graduate student already familiar with the background material, allowing that scholar’s sense of validation and surprise to guide the work with data. In ‘hybrid' work, where computer scientists and humanists work on the same team to produce new knowledge, collaborating over multiple iterations and investigations, there can be a division of labor around the research.  In general, a high caliber of work can only be accomplished by teams where at least one valued member is as serious about history as they are about algorithmic study.

Not every historian needs access to every kind of background knowledge. If a course on Victorian Britain offers the ideal background for text mining the parliamentary debates, a course on American history offers a much better background to working with the Congressional Record. Scholars who have studied Latin American, African, or Asian history will necessarily have the background to work with other datasets. The point here is that understanding a time and a place represents a commitment of reading dozens of books. No single Wikipedia article or textbook will substitute for this work, and only this background work really equips an analyst to ask the questions about consensus and surprise that outfit an analyst for understanding when their data work is validating what scholars already know and when their data work has advanced to the discovery of something truly surprising.

For the purpose of our question about the abolition debatees in parliament, we recommend extra background reading in the major sources we consulted to summarize the debates above:

* David Ryden, West Indian Slavery and British Abolition, 1783-1807 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005)
* Adam Hochschild, Bury the Chains: Prophets and Rebels in the Fight to Free an Empire (Boston: Houghton Mifflen, 2006).
* Christopher Leslie Brown, Moral Capital: Foundations of British Abolitionism (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2006)
* Richard Huzzey, Freedom Burning: Salvery and Empire in Victorian Britain (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2012).
* Claudius K. Fergus, Revolutionary Emancipation, Slavery and Abolitionism in the British West Indies (Baton Rouge, Louisiana State University Press, 2013).
* Robert Burroughs and Richard Huzzey, eds., The Suppression of the Atlantic Slave Trade (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2015)
* Paula Dumas, Proslavery Britain: Fighting for Slavery in an Era of Abolition (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2016).
* Padraic X. Scanlan, Slave Empire: How Slavery Built Modern Britain (Boston: Little, Brown, 2020).
* Tom Zoellner, Island on Fire: The Revolt that Ended Slavery in the British Empire (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2022).

Note that we have attempted to gather titles from the past two decades, with perspectives ranging from an overview of the abolition movement to the biography of the abolitionists, to the pro-slavery lobby that argued against abolition and for apprenticeships, to the larger question of how imbricated slavery was within the British economy, to the Jamaican revolt of 1831 that forced Britain to end slavery.

Engagement with historical secondary sources is one of the markers of serious Digital History work which is frequently absent in publications from Computer Science or Data Science, with the result that it is sometimes unclear what the original contribution of a given article is to the historical literature.  We believe that setting a higher standard of innovation in scholarship –- by demanding findings that are literally surprising to the field -- is a healthy practice, raising the bar for computational investigations of the human past. 

The analyst beginning research on a problem of this kind does not necessarily have to read all of these books with equal attentiveness. But it is useful to spend a few hours reading at least the introductions to these books (or more recent contributions to the debate) to see what the authors agree and disagree about, which themes or ideas they find most interesting. 

In the sections of text that follow, as we pursue the question more deeply, we will return to secondary sources, seeking out more specialized texts, for instance biographies of the individuals whose words we count. Pay attention to the footnotes and the texts that we cite to understand how the need for background knowledge evolves with research.

# Finding the Research Question that the Tools of Text Mining Can Address

First, we need to think about the fit between the tools of text mining and the issue of the abolition of slavery. As explained above, we don't have the source base in Hansard to contribute to burning questions about the role of enslaved persons in pursuing their own freedom. If all we have is Hansard, we need to retailor our question to the dataset we have. With Hansard, we can count mentions of slavery and the way that slavery is addressed by the spakers who were in power at the time when slavery was nominally abolished throughout British empire. Can we write a research question that might light to insights on the basis of word count?

One place to start is with the speakers in parliament who contributed the most to the 1833 debates about slavery. As we saw in a previous chapter, one place where text mining excels is simply counting the number of words contributed to a given issue by individual speakers. Based on word counts, we can expect to accurately identify the speakers in parliament who contributed the most to the slavery question.

We can then move to asking about the language they shared to the language that makes each of their contributions unique. Another place where text mining excels is counting the words from each individual speaker, finding the words they shared and the words that were most distinctive of each speaker. 

Why would we want to understand the words that made the principal speakers different? Because it may tell us something important about what they disagreed about.  An understanding of the poles of debate can lead us to a detailed case about the tensions that emerged in parliament around abolition. 

From this question we may be able to navigate to an original contribution about the role of arguments in parliament, perhaps contributing information that other historians have not been able to pull from their research. 

## Top Speakers in the Debates About Slavery

In a previous chapter, we looked into the top speakers in parliament in a given year. In this exercise, we want to begin by finding just those speakers who spoke the most in debates about slavery. We can use `str_detect()` to look for the word "slavery" in the titles of debate. Then we could the top speakers.

If you are new to code, take a moment to notice how changing only one line in the code below produces a different angle of analysis.  The code below is otherwise very similar to the code in the previous chapters. One of the great pleasures of coding is the facility with which a few skills can quickly become powerful in the hands of an analyst who has many questions.

           y = words_pspy, # y axis = word count

                                                 (max(x) + 1) * 1))))) +  
  theme_light() # light theme styling
```

You may notice that we have produced a different sort of visualization than the bar charts of the previous chapter. The ggplot library of graphics is a highly flexible language for producing many visualizations from the same data. Rather than the command for a bar chart -- `geom_col()` -- we have used a command for a dot plot -- `geom_point()`. With this plot we also introduce another library, `ggrepel`, which gives us tools for enhancing the readability of our plot by making sure that labels do not overlap.

What does this chart of the top speakers about slavery tell us? The chart gives us some suggestions about where to start looking. It tells us that the five speakers who contributed the most to the debate in 1830 spoke twice as much as the speakers in other debates of the decade.  The list of these speakers gives us a good place to start looking at data.  The main speakers in 1833 were Edward Stanley, the Duke of Wellington, James Silk Buckingham, Fowell Burton, and Robert Peel.  We also see the evidence of a second wave of debates, when issues of indentured servitude came to parliament's attention in 1838.  Then, Lord Brougham and Lord Gleneig were the main contenders. 

Wellington, Peel, Stanley, and Buckingham form a distinct set. Wellington and Stanley had the most in common. Wellington was a former and future prime minister and the hero of Waterloo. Stanley, the Earl of Derby, a future prime minister, was currently in transition from his role as Chief Secretary for Ireland to Secretary of War and the Colonies. His career was associated with the abolition of slavery, military rule and the establishment of schools for Ireland, and the expansion of the vote to the middle class. Both came from noble families; both were Whigs, although Wellington was three decades older. 

Exploring the contributions of the top speakers and the tensions between them is one area in which the tools of text mining excel. 

## Using Our Skills to Explore the Historical Debates About the Abolition of Slavery

Understanding how to group data by speaker and year gives us the possibility of closely studying the contribution of different speakers.  For instance, suppose that we wanted to read all of the debates relating to Slavery Abolition Act of 1833, which outlawed slavery in many British colonies, including the Caribbean and South Africa, although not across much of India, where debt slavery would persist for decades, and where the caste system would exclude many people from participation in the economy through the twenty-first century.

There are some new commands below that are used for demonstration purposes to show how one might navigate our newly joined dataset. Don't feel worried if you can't read every line. You will be learning how to aggregate data by speaker very soon.

```{r, message = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# find the words spoken about slavery in the year 1833
slavery_debates_1833 <- slavery_debates_1830 %>%
  filter(year == "1833") # filter for just the year 1833 

# count how many times each speaker says each word in the slavery debates of 1833
words_per_speaker_slavery_1833 <- slavery_debates_1833 %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>% # break up into words the contents of the column 'text', creating a new column called 'word'
  group_by(speaker) %>% # group the data by speaker
  summarize(words_per_speaker = n()) %>% # create a new column for how many words each speaker says
  arrange(desc(words_per_speaker)) %>% # arrange in descending order
  slice(1:20) # retain just the top 20 words per speaker

# inspect the first few rows of the data to make sure it looks right
head(words_per_speaker_slavery_1833)
```

Counting how many words were spoken in the 6,000 some sentences about the abolition of British slavery is our first reminder of the bias of this data set: the speakers are white men, many of them of a class invested in slavery. This collection of words is not suitable for investigating narratives that depict lived experiences of dehumanization, recorded from the words of enslaved people.

Nevertheless, distant reading allows us to investigate the dynamics of politics in the British parliamentary system that made the official abolition of slavery possible. We can take a snapshot at the speeches of the most active speakers -- Buckingham, Stanley, Wellington, and Peel -- by comparing their most-invoked words in these debates.

In the following code, we provide a list of speakers and use the `%in%` operator to filter for any of these speakers. 

```{r, message = F}
library(knitr)

# make a list of the names of the top speakers, using the quotation marks to tell the computer that the contents are textual strings
pattern1 = c("Mr. Fowell Buxton", "Mr. Buckingham", "Mr. Stanley", "The Duke of Wellington", "Sir Robert Peel")

# search for the words said by the speakers in pattern1 
top_slavery_speakers_1833 <- slavery_debates_1833 %>%
  filter(speaker %in% pattern1) # retain only the rows were the speaker's name is in the list pattern1 

# inspect the data
kable(top_slavery_speakers_1833)
```

Next, let's break the text into words and clean it up, removing numbers and stop words. We're lemmatizing each word into its word stem so that we can count singular and plural of the same word as one.

```{r, message = F}
library(textstem)

# clean up the list of words
filtered_words_per_top_slavery_speaker_1833 <- top_slavery_speakers_1833 %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>% # break up into words 
  filter(!str_detect(word,"^\\s*[0-9]*\\s*$")) %>% # remove all numbers 
  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word") %>% # remove stopwords 
  #anti_join(custom_stop_words, by = "word")  %>% # remove any words in the custom_stop_words list
  mutate(word = lemmatize_words(word))  # lemmatize the word, reducing each word to its word stem for counting 

# inspect the data
head(filtered_words_per_top_slavery_speaker_1833)
```

Next, let's count the words by how many times each speaker says them.

For our visualization, we will look at only the words spoken most frequently.

```{r, message = F}
top_words_per_abolition_speaker <- filtered_words_per_top_slavery_speaker_1833 %>%
  group_by(speaker, word) %>% # group the data by speaker 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% # count how many times each word is spoken by each speaker
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% # arrange in descending order
  slice(1:15)  # find the 15 words that each speaker says the most frequently 
  
kable(top_words_per_abolition_speaker)
```

Now visualize: 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# create a plot of each speakers' favorite words 
top_words_per_abolition_speaker %>% 
  mutate(word = reorder_within(word, n, speaker)) %>% # within the grouping by speaker, rearrange the words in order by n
  ggplot( # create a plot 
    aes(x = word, # word is on the x axis
        y = n)) + # n (count) is on the y axis
  geom_col() + # make a bar chart
  facet_wrap(~speaker, # break the chart up into faceted charts, one for each speaker
             scales = "free") + # label each x and y axis separately, so that we only see the words used by that speaker on his axis
  coord_flip() + # switch the x and y axis labels (this is an elegant shortcut for other work moving labels that we'd have to do otherwise)
  scale_x_reordered() + # reorder the column before plotting with faceting 
  labs(title = "Speakers\' Favorite Words", # give a title
       subtitle = "From the 1833 Debates on the Abolition of Slavery", # give a subtitle
       x = "Word", # label the x axis 
       y = "Count") # label the y axis
```

## From Concepts to ideas

What can we learn from this visualization about the history of slavery? How might we use the tools of text mining to learn something new about this important historical moment?

What shows up clearly in the counts of most frequently-used words is a series of keywords that motivated debate. The fact that all five speakers invoke the terms "slavery," "freedom," and "labour" suggests that they are operating as what historians call "concepts" -- the theoretical constellations of ideas that produced much of the modern world.  Terms such as "nation," "republic," "democracy," and "development" were argued over and redefined over the course of decades and centuries, until the terms eventually stabilized. 

Historians believe that identifying the debates over these words is key to understanding the abstract forces that remade society, or the "conceptual changes" by which modern understanding was produced.  Peter de Bolla and his coauthors defined concepts as "'cultural entities' held by many agents collectively, that is held by a 'culture'." (de Bolla et. al). They argue that concepts allow cultures to feel their way through increasingly abstract modes of ideation, because concepts "provide the scaffolding that enables one to understand whatever is the object of attention and thought." In the era of the debates over the abolition of slavery, the concept "freedom" was doing just such important work, allowing ordinary British people and the politicians who represented them to reckon with certain aspects of the abhorrent economic reality that made Britain so rich in the age of empire: the fact that Britain's wealth was largely due to the plunder of wealth from foreign lands and especially the theft of time from the millions of enslaved humans who harvested sugar, tea, cotton, and the other raw materials upon which empire's trade was based. Talking about "freedom" formed the basis for reckoning with capitalism and empire as systems, for holding them account to a higher set of principles. That work was at its infancy in the era of the British laws that outlawed the Atlantic slave trade and slavery in some parts of British empire, but the work of defining and promoting freedom continues to this day as the specific cases and principles that comprise freedom continue to be brought into consciousness through the work of social movements, politics, and ideation.

Historically speaking, as concepts arise, they tend to be contested. At the beginning, there was no single definition of "science" or "nation" to which all parties subscribed; these terms had to be debated and argued over until they became abstract ideas that could be invoked in support of other debates. Corpus linguistics gives us useful clues about how to identify potential concepts: as a rule of thumb, the words spoken about the most in any debates are those that are most contested. In the debates of 1833, we can tell that the words "slavery," "freedom," and "labour" may fit such a description. Often the words spoken most frequently are words whose definition is up for grabs; speakers who disagree with each other will talk at great length to assert their own definition of one of these key concepts. The two speakers who mention freedom the most in 1833 are Buckingham and Peel, and we might expect that they represent two poles of disagreement about what freedom is or should be.

One part of unpacking the life of concepts is to understand the contestation of concepts by individuals as they formulate ideas and arguments.  In this usage, we follow de Bolla and his collaborators call the individual uses of concepts by writers and speakers "ideas" (de Bolla et al Ch 2.1.2).  Therefore, for the following discussion, let us use "concept" to reference that shared terminology of values, especially "freedom," while reserving "idea" for any other terms we might use to understand how individual speakers make their cases. When people in the past argued about how to define terms like "freedom," they used many examples. Words such as "wages," "apprenticeship," and "regulation" were used in the slavery debates to signal how freedom was to be achieved.

We already have enough material to hypothesize about some major differences that marked the speakers out in their construction of the problems of freedom and slavery. Buckingham and Buxton, representing the abolition lobby, are more inclined to talk about the "negro" -- a term whose usage has changed, but that in its early nineteenth-century context, was a reference to a color -- black -- via the Latin _nigrum_. Perhaps they were inclined to reference the individual experiences of enslaved persons -- although this is a conjecture, something we'd need to check in the text. Buckingham also uses words for abstract values such as "enjoyment' and "life," where Buxton is more willing to talk about facts on the ground in "Jamaica," for instance the "insurrection." 

Problems of imperial governance concern the other speakers, whose personal background was associated less with middle-class abolition movements than with the military and colonial order of British empire. Peel speaks of "colonies," "compensation," and "proprietors;" if we have read some background to the debates, we might guess that Peel is wrapped up with the technical questions of whether the imperial parliament in Westminster has the right to tell the colonial government in Jamaica, and what will be the fallout if the Westminster parliament tells the white planters in Jamaica that their property is suddenly invalid.  Stanley's eyes are on markets -- he speaks of "sugar," the major project produced by slave labor, "averages" (a hint that he may be speaking in technical terms about economic production, although we would need to read more to understand how), and "compensation" and "colonies," like Peel. Wellington's eyes are also on imperial issues, drawing attention (perhaps) to the implications of debates over slavery for India (although again more reading would be necessary to understand how India is being invoked).

Our many parenthetical remarks in the paragraph are an important reminder that we are merely at the stage of hypothesis generation. We do not have enough material from this list of keywords to interpret the debates. We may begin to identify words and speakers for further analysis.

Even in a distant reading, we can detect that Robert Peel and the Duke of Wellington were more interested in problems of "compensation" for the owners who benefited from the system of enslavement than in the details of life in the West Indies -- an issue of political expediency, but also a reflection of the ethical orientation of parliament in the 1830s.

### The Most Distinctive Words of the Top Speakers About Slavery

If we want to see the words that make each speaker distinct as opposed to their top words, we will need a different tool than raw word count. We might hypothesize, for instance, that Buckingham talks about "freedom" more than the other speakers in the group, because "freedom" is ranked as the third word for Buckingham but the eleventh for Buxton, the fifth for Peel, and somewhere lower still for Wellington and Stanley. But the truth is that we don't know how statistically important these differences are without further comparison. Thinking about the problem with greater statistical richness means asking how many times Buckingham uttered "freedom" relative to the number of words Buckingham spoke in the slavery debates overall; we need to know not just the full count of one word, but how many individual words he used and how frequently he said each, relative to the other speakers. In short, statistics become important when we want to compare individuals. 

What we need is a "distinctiveness measure," a statistical tool that allows us to rank an index of how "distinctive" a word is of each speaker.  Further on in this book, we will go into the technicalities of measures of distinction in greater detail, the varieties of algorithms that can be used for this purpose, and how they work. For now, it is enough to know that "distinctiveness" is a useful tool for understanding which words each speakers says more relative to the other speakers. 

Distinctiveness can help us to answer the question: what were the words that Buckingham said that other speakers did not say? What were the words that Peel uttered that other speakers never used? If raw word count helps us to understand which concepts speakers may be arguing over, distinctiveness helps us to interpret which keywords those speakers used to support their argument.

Using the function `bind_tf_idf()` we can apply an index of how distinctive each word is of each speaker. The tf-idf function will create an index for each term-speaker pair -- a number which, if high, tells us that the word was very distinctive of each speaker, and if low, tell us that many of the speakers used the same word. 

The `bind_tf_idf()` function takes three arguments. The first two are the names of the facets of the data which are to be assessed for how distinctive they are in relationship to each other -- in this case, `word` and `speaker`. The third argument, `n`, the count of words per speaker. 

```{r, message = F}
# calculate the measure of how distinctive each keyword is of each speaker
tfidf_per_top_slavery_speaker_1833 <- top_words_per_abolition_speaker %>% # start with a dataframe with wordcounts per speaker
  bind_tf_idf(word, speaker, n) %>% # In this case, the groupings of words we want to explore ('document') are the speakers
  arrange(desc(tf_idf))

# inspect the data
kable(tfidf_per_top_slavery_speaker_1833)
```

Note that the `bind_tf_idf()` function creates three new columns -- `tf`, `idf`, and `tf_idf`. The one we really care about is the last, `tf_idf`, an index of how distinctive each word is of each speaker. A very high `tf_idf` marks words that are said very frequently by one speaker and never by any other speakers. A very low tf_idf marks words that are rarely said by anyone or said by everyone with nearly the same frequency.  Looking for the high `tf_idf` words for each speaker will tell us which words are most unique to them -- a useful clue to the distinctive arguments, ideas, and referents that each speaker contributed to the debate.

Now that we have an index of how distinctive each word is per speaker, we can use this distinctiveness tool to find which words are most distinctive of each speaker.

```{r, message = F}
# find the words most distinctive of each speaker
most_distinctive_words_per_abolition_speaker <- tfidf_per_top_slavery_speaker_1833 %>%
  group_by(speaker) %>% # group by speaker
  arrange(desc(tf_idf)) %>% # arrange in descending order of tf_idf, the index of how distinctive each word is of each speaker
  slice(1:15) %>% # find the top n words, ranked by tf_idf
  ungroup() %>% # ungroup the words
  mutate(index = row_number()) %>% # create a new column, "index," which tells what the #1-4 word is for each speaker
  mutate(tf_idf = round(tf_idf, 4)) %>% # round the tf_idf score to only 4 decimal places 
  select(index, word, tf_idf, n, speaker) # drop all columns except these

# create a series of smaller datasets reflecting the top speakers
speaker1 <- most_distinctive_words_per_abolition_speaker %>% 
  filter(speaker == pattern1[1]) %>% 
  select(word, tf_idf)

speaker2 <- most_distinctive_words_per_abolition_speaker %>% 
  filter(speaker == pattern1[2]) %>% 
  select(word, tf_idf)

speaker3 <- most_distinctive_words_per_abolition_speaker %>% 
  filter(speaker == pattern1[3])%>% 
  select(word, tf_idf)

speaker4 <- most_distinctive_words_per_abolition_speaker %>% 
  filter(speaker == pattern1[4])%>% 
  select(word, tf_idf)

speaker5 <- most_distinctive_words_per_abolition_speaker %>% 
  filter(speaker == pattern1[5])%>% 
  select(word, tf_idf)
```

Next, let's create a series of small tables displaying each speaker, their most distinctive words, and the `tf_idf` score of that word-speaker combination. 

We could create a bar graph, of course, but because `tf_idf` measures represent an abstract concept -- distinctiveness -- visualizing this data risks confusing some possible readers, who might mistake the bar graph of `tf_idf` for a count of frequency.  Analysts often have to make choices about how to represent their data so as to generate the least confusion about the meaning of any statistical measure. For abstract indexes like `tf_idf`, generated in the course of our research, we recommend offering simple tables along with prose that explains the significance of the numbers.

```{r, message = F}
kable(speaker1, caption = unique(most_distinctive_words_per_abolition_speaker$speaker)[1])
```
```{r, message = F}
kable(speaker2, caption = unique(most_distinctive_words_per_abolition_speaker$speaker)[2])
```
```{r, message = F}
kable(speaker3, caption = unique(most_distinctive_words_per_abolition_speaker$speaker)[3])
```
```{r, message = F}
kable(speaker4, caption = unique(most_distinctive_words_per_abolition_speaker$speaker)[4])
```
```{r, message = F}
kable(speaker5, caption = unique(most_distinctive_words_per_abolition_speaker$speaker)[5])
```

The first thing that our measure of distinctiveness helps to clarify is what is not distinctive. The words "freedom," "labour," and "slavery" are not particularly distinctive of any speaker -- all five speakers use these words a great deal, and no one uses any of the words so much more often than the others as to merit an index of the words as distinctive.  

Instead, we have a new set of words that might qualify as "ideas" in the sense that they signify the unique contribution of each of the five speakers on the larger debate about the meanings of the concepts "freedom" and "slavery." Words such as "enjoyment" (for Buckingham), "wage" (for Buxton), "imperial" (for Peel), and "petition" (favored by Wellington) give a sense of the varying priorities of individuals.

It's worth making a list of the words that intrigue us, about which we might want to know more.  It seems, for example, that each of the speakers cultivated their own set of examples and references -- places whose anecdotes they used as examples for thinking through the consequences of continued slavery, the "apprenticeship" system of continued slavery, and immediate abolition.  One route through the research might be to stop here and examine those terms and their references, looking up one at a time:

  Buxton: Hottentots, Africans, Scotchman
  Stanley: Venezuela, mine
  Peel: Burke, Guadeloupe
  Wellington: Colombia 
  
We may make many such hypotheses in the course of reading. It is always worth writing them down; we may always choose to return to them later. One valid use of text mining is exactly as a source for new hypotheses about the text and how they matter. 
 
Before we get too excited about any of these words, however, we also need to think about the usefulness of word count and distinctiveness together. One of the tricky things about working with tf-idf is that it's a measure of distinctiveness, not a measure of significance. Which is to say that a highly-ranked word from any of these lists may be so distinctive because it was only spoken twice, and both times by one person. Does that make the word worthy of note? Not necessarily -- it might just be irrelevant. 

We can check the significance of our distinctiveness measure by another kind of representation of the same data, one that brings both distinctiveness and count into the same graphic. 

```{r, message = F}
# create a chart
most_distinctive_words_per_abolition_speaker %>%
  mutate(word = reorder_within(word, n, speaker)) %>% # rearrange the data by n and speaker
  ggplot(aes( # create a chart
    x = word,  # word on the x axis 
    y = n, # n on the y axis
    fill = factor(tf_idf) )) + # the color of the bars in the bar chart will reflect tf_idf. 
    # we must tell the computer to treat tf_idf as a "factor' because the the numbers are enumerated rather than continuous.
  geom_col() + # create a bar chart
  facet_wrap(~speaker, scales = "free") + # create a series of mini-charts, breaking the data up by speaker
  coord_flip() + # switch the information on x and y axes (this is a shortcut to make the 'word' labels easy to read)
  scale_x_reordered() + # keep the 'word' axis ordered by n and speaker
  scale_fill_grey() + # use a gray scale (if this line is removed, a color chart will be produced)
  guides(fill = "none") + # don't show a legend for the colors of the bar chart (if removed, a color legend will be shown)
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = function(x) 
    unique(floor(pretty(seq(min(x), (max(x) + 1) * 1))))) + # use whole numbers, not  decimals, for the x axis +
  labs(title = "Speakers\' Most Distinctive Words", # label the visualization with a title
       subtitle = "From the Debates in the 1830s on the Abolition of Slavery; pale means more distinctive", # text for the subtitle
       x = "Word", # x axis label
       y = "Count") # y axis label
```

As opposed to the list, our bar chart shows both tf-idf distinctiveness (represented as paleness of the bar) with count on the x axis.  This visualization can guide us as to whether we want to investigate a particular word because of its distinctiveness -- or whether that word might be a poor marker of significance. For instance, most of Stanley's distinctive words are revealed to have a wordcount of only 2, which is too few to be significant; it simply doesn't make sense that "rum," "mine," and "barrel" merit investigation when Stanley spoke them only twice in his voluminous speech-giving -- that is, unless we already had a previous interest in the rum trade and its intersection with slavery. Statistically distinctive these words might be; worthy of further investigation they are not (at least not necessarily). 

We can use wordcount with distinctiveness to identify a set of words that we do indeed wish to pursue further. We can see that the words "wage," "rear," "hottentots," and "flog" are, for Fowell Buxton, both distinctive and numerous, as are "ultimate," "qualify," "imperial," and "king's" For Robert Peel; nearly all of Stanley's words are distinctive, while Mr. Buckingham's most distinctive word, "thirdly," appears to be a mere rhetorical tick. 

Nevertheless, there is room for caveats about settling for these words in particular.  From the point of view of text mining, where we look to the number of words as significant, these results are unsatisfying. There are too many small results, where the count is smaller than 5. If we want to write an analysis of each speakers' referents, this might be a beginning, but we should not rest content that we have the best words for examinig the speakers yet. Let's rerun the code, this time adding instructions to only show us words that appear above a certain threshold. To do this, we will add just a single line of code. You can play with the number in the filter to see how the results change as we look for more and less distinctive words.

```{r, message = F}
most_distinctive_words_per_abolition_speaker2 <- tfidf_per_top_slavery_speaker_1833 %>%
  group_by(speaker) %>%
  filter(n > 5) %>% # <----------------  this is the only thing that's new 
  arrange(desc(tf_idf)) %>%
  mutate(rank_tf_idf = row_number()) %>%
  slice(1:15) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(word = reorder_within(word, n, speaker))

most_distinctive_words_per_abolition_speaker
```

```{r, message = F}
ggplot(data = most_distinctive_words_per_abolition_speaker2, 
       aes(x = word, y = n, fill = factor(tf_idf) )) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_grey() +
  facet_wrap(~speaker, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_x_reordered() + 
  guides(fill = "none") +
   scale_y_continuous(breaks = function(x) 
     unique(floor(pretty(seq(min(x), (max(x) + 1) * 1))))) + # use whole numbers, not decimals, for the x axis +
  labs(title = "Speakers\' Most Distinctive Words with N > 5",
       subtitle = "From the Debates in the 1830s on the Abolition of Slavery; pale means more distinctive",
       x = "Word",
       y = "Count")
```

With this new view, it is less clear that Mr. Buckingham wanted for distinctive words. His use of "enjoyment," "wage," "reward," and "grow" are notable.

At this point, we may want to choose one speaker to inspect in greater detail. Our choice of which speaker to investigate might be motivated by distant reading or not. We are not compelled to investigate Edward Stanley because he spoke more than anyone else. We have used wordcount to guide me to five possible candidates. Nor are we forced to choose which candidate from these five to investigate further on the basis of which words they spoke or which words the computer finds distinctive. We can also make decisions based on outside reading, and good historians usually do.   

Suppose we choose to investigate Mr. Buckingham. He is, after all, the outlier -- a new arrival in parliament, elected by the evangelical middle class who obtained a presence in parliament only after 1832. We can use this information to investigate certain aspects of his speech. We might decide to grow curious about what he had to say about "enjoyment," "wage," "bonage," and "america," to take a smattering of his most distinctive words for this view. 

What might we learn if we looked at Mr. Buckingham's words in greater detail?  The visualizations above limit us to a small number of words per speaker; but we might learn a great deal more by looking at Mr. Buckingham's favorite words, whether by count of by tf-idf. In fact, computation is cheap, so let's do both. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
mr_buckingham_slavery_debates <- tfidf_per_top_slavery_speaker_1833 %>%
  filter(speaker == "Mr. Buckingham") %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  slice(1:40)
  
mr_buckingham_slavery_debates

ggplot(data = mr_buckingham_slavery_debates,
       aes(x = reorder(word, n), # the x axis will show words ordered by their count 
           y = n),
          fill = factor(tf_idf)) + # the y axis will show n 
  scale_fill_grey() +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = function(x) 
    unique(floor(pretty(seq(min(x), (max(x) + 1) * 1))))) + # use whole numbers, not decimals, for the x axis +
  geom_col() + # create a bar graph 
  coord_flip() + # switches the x and y axis for a more elegant presentation 
  labs(title = "Mr Buckingham\'s Most Frequenlty Spoken Words", # this is another way of labeling title and axes
       subtitle = "From the 1833 Debates on the Abolition of Slavery",
       x = "Word",
       y = "Count")
```

It is interesting that "labour" and "freedom" are used alongside "slavery" and "slave" as Buckingham"s favorite words. Also pronounced are his invocation of "rights," "wages," and "people," suggesting that Buckingham was interested in drawing equivalencies between the rights of working men in Britain and the rights of enslaved people in the West Indies.

But none of these words are particularly distinctive of Mr. Buckingham, at least in terms of their statistical profile. It's not clear that he used "labour" and "freedom" any more than other speakers. In fact, his top 50 words have a distinctiveness score of zero. 

If we want to see the words that Buckingham used more than other speakers, we can return to the tf-idf scores that we generated a moment ago. In fact, all we have to do is change a single line of code to produce a visualization showing the top forty most distinctive words and their counts.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
mr_buckingham_slavery_debates2 <- tfidf_per_top_slavery_speaker_1833 %>%
  filter(speaker == "Mr. Buckingham") %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf)) %>% # <------- the only line that changed
  slice(1:40)

ggplot(data = mr_buckingham_slavery_debates2,
       aes(x = reorder(word, n), # the x axis will show words ordered by their count 
           y = n),
          fill = factor(tf_idf)) + # the y axis will show n 
  scale_fill_grey() +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = function(x) 
    unique(floor(pretty(seq(min(x), (max(x) + 1) * 1))))) + # use whole numbers for the x axis
  geom_col() + # create a bar graph 
  coord_flip() + # switches the x and y axis for a more elegant presentation 
  labs(title = "Mr Buckingham\'s Most Distinctive Words", # this is another way of labeling title and axes
       subtitle = "From the 1833 Debate on the Abolition of Slavery",
       x = "Word",
       y = "Count")
```

"Wages" emerges as a more distinctive word of Buckingham's that he said quite frequently -- 12 times in all. It is not his most distinctive word; to find that, we can very slightly alter the code above to find the word he uses more than anyone else -- but the result may be disappointing. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
mr_buckingham_most_distinctive_word <- tfidf_per_top_slavery_speaker_1833 %>%
  filter(speaker == "Mr. Buckingham") %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf)) %>% 
  slice(1) # <------- the only line that changed

mr_buckingham_most_distinctive_word
```

"Thirdly" is merely a rhetorical habit.  

More interesting are substantive words that (perhaps) indicate Buckingham's values:
    wages
    enjoyment
    love
    universal
    independent
    devoted

-- as well as the vices he (perhaps) abhors:
    servitude
    vindictiveness
    possessions
    ignorance
    grind[ing]
    destructive
    groundless
    cruel
    burthen

The "perhaps" is crucial. We are noting possible avenues for investigation for ourselves; this is not yet a proven list of findings from digital history. We should not be too quick to leap to conclusions about how Buckingham used these words without reading directly from his speeches. 

```{r, message = F}
library(kableExtra)

# finding just the sentences where Buckingham uses the word "wages"
buckingham_sentences <- slavery_debates_1833 %>%
  filter(speaker == "Mr. Buckingham",
         str_detect(text, "wages"))

# some fancy code to format the results as a table
kable(buckingham_sentences,
      format = "latex",
      booktabs = TRUE,
      caption = "Buckingham's sentences about slavery invoking the word 'wages'") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"))
```

Here they are as plaintext:

```{r}
buckingham_sentences$text
```

We see in these sentences that Buckingham is using "wages" in concert with the concepts of "freedom," "labour," and "property" to recapitulate a Lockean argument about how property depends on the work of men to enclose land, and how the duty fo the state is to uphold contracts that will protect exchanges built upon this system, upon which capitalism rests.  A string of sentences follow about the specificities of wages. But the details are hard to interpret, in part because we are missing important context. 

But before continuing further, we should observe that the sentences in our dataset are not necessarily from a single speech or even debate. If we look at their sentence_id numbers, we will see that the numbers are not contiguous. These sentences came in the train of other sentences which are missing in this dataset. To interpret any individual sentence correctly, a data analyst must be aware of the importance of understanding that what we are seeing here is a series of discrete statements made on different days.  

```{r, message = F}
buckingham_sentences$sentence_id
```

Sentences in Hansard are literally numbered by the order in which they appear in print. Some of the sentences numbers above occurred near to each other and may be from the same speech, but no sentences are actually back-to-back in their original context. There is information missing.

Missing information is the result of our strategy of identifying words like "slavery" and "wages" that appear within the same sentence. For the purpose of picking up on general patterns, this manner of counting and generalizing is useful. But if we abstract sentences from their context, it is almost impossible to tell what is going on.

Fortunately, we are not constrained by filtering for words. We can always go back to the original context of the speech or debate in which a sentence appears. We can use our list of `sentence_id` numbers to call up the entire speeches of which each sentence is a part (further down we will explain more about the technicalities of what happens in this section).

If we were working on a paper analyzing these speeches, we would likely want to read Buckingham's speeches about slavery in their entirety; the same would be true if our research project concerned the corporate reports of a company or a series of lawsuits.  The process of reading and understanding cannot be replaced by counting words and analyzing them. Students of data science who pursue wordcount without background reading inevitably arrive at weak, useless or nonsensical results.

For the moment, let us proceed by reading a limited sample of Buckingham's speeches about slavery -- just those speeches in which he invoked the word "wages." 

The code for obtaining the speeches is given below; the full speech is printed in the Appendix.

```{r, message = F}
# moving from a list of sentences to the full speeches for context
buck_speech_ids <- buckingham_sentences %>% 
  select(sentence_id) 

buck_speeches <- buck_speech_ids %>%
  left_join(hansard_1830, by = "sentence_id") 

# some fancy code to turn it into a table
kable(
  buck_speeches,
  format   = "latex",                         # PDF needs LaTeX
  booktabs = TRUE,                            # nicer rules; requires \usepackage{booktabs}
  col.names = NULL,                           # no header row ("" can confuse LaTeX)
  caption  = "Three Speeches by Buckingham about Slavery that invoke the word 'wages'") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "hold_position"))
```

With missing sentences added back in, the speeches in their entirety are much easier to understand. 

Mr. Buckingham began his long speech by introducing the three constituencies who demanded the abolition of slavery. Some are motivated by religion, others by claims about freedom, justice, and the British Constitution; and still others on moral or economic grounds, which Buckingham summarized as "policy alone." 

Reviewing the call from religious circles for immediate abolition, and from policy and constitutional circles for delay, we see Buckingham invoking "wages" in the midst of a detailed case for immediate abolition.  He challenges the proposals in the 1834 legislation to abolish slavery that called for a period of "apprenticeship," when enslaved people would be nominally freed but still forced to work without pay. The bill that finally passed would require apprenticeship, and historians have since argued that this unwillingness to end slavery represents a failure of the British state to commit to freedom.  In Buckingham's arguments, we see the politician as a man ahead of his time -- arguing that "apprenticeship" or "servitude" was an undisguised synonym for slavery, and denouncing any act that extended the period of enslavement. 

We also see, in the second speech, we see Buckingham extraoplating from his experience of working with forced labor on naval vessels to the question of apprenticeship. We see him calling up another one of his more distinctive keywords -- "America" -- to make the case that the independent United States provided a historical example of the success of freeing an expensive colony to self-government. 

Buckingham's commitments to endorse the humanity and rights of enslaved humans are abundantly clear.  We see him making a detailed argument against the category of race itself as the basis for political or economic assumptions, especially assumptions about inferiority.  He makes a case for dark-skinned people freely associating and participating in the economies of the Mediterranean, invoking ancient Egypt and the biblical Queen of Sheba too argue that dark-skinned Africans and their interracial descendents were destined for economic success.   

We see Buckingham arguing that the free market naturally rewards laborers who choose dangerous work. Buckingham later generalizes about the rewards of a free market from his experience in Sheffield observing steel grinders and the high wages they commanded.  Buckingham is arguing that only the freedom of wages -- not apprenticeship -- will induce formerly enslaved men to take on challenging work.

In this reading, the word "wages" is a category that allows Buckingham to navigate between his concerns and those of other policy-makers. Buckingham's invocation of wages suggest that he believes that capitalism has a utopian side in the freedoms it offers to workers. His anecdotes about Sheffield's steel workers and British naval vesslels suggest that he...

But we are not done. We can use the distinctive words in our list  to investigate other aspects of the speech.

```{r, message = F}
buckingham_sentences_2 <- slavery_debates_1830 %>%
  left_join(speaker_metadata_1830) %>%
  filter(speaker == "Mr. Buckingham",
         str_detect(text, "enjoyment"))
```

```{r}
buckingham_sentences_2$text
```

If the example of "wages" furnished sentences difficult to understand without broader context, the sentences about "enjoyment" give an example where Buckingham's case is clear without any further effort peering into the text. His utopian vision of capitalism becomes clear in these passages, which posit the conjecture that the freedom to work on a wage market gives labourers access to "enjoyment," and that enjoyment and its natural incentives therefore offers a reason why the slaves should be freed.

```{r, message = F}
buckingham_sentences_3 <- slavery_debates_1830 %>%
  left_join(speaker_metadata_1830) %>%
  filter(speaker == "Mr. Buckingham",
         str_detect(text, "love"))
```

```{r}
buckingham_sentences_3$text
```

We might also elect to investigate "love," one of the words that appeared highly ranked through tf-idf but relatively sparse. We investigated the word because we felt that it might represent one of a set of virtues to which Buckingham looked -- alongside "universal," "desire," and "religion."

This is a dead end. When we consult the text, we do not find an endorsement of "love" as a universal virtue that we hypothesized when we looked at the word list. Instead, we find the use of phrases such as "love of ease," "love of liberty," and "love of repose," as Buckingham invokes conjectures about the motivations of humankind, endorsing none of them. It would be foolhardy to make any kind of a positive argument about statements so diverse as these. We could try to unify them under one statement, but we would be falsifying evidence.  In a research paper we will have no use for these examples, and we will pass over the word "love" without remark. 

```{r, message = F}
buckingham_sentences_4 <- slavery_debates_1830 %>%
  left_join(speaker_metadata_1830) %>%
  filter(speaker == "Mr. Buckingham",
         str_detect(text, "universal"))
```

```{r}
buckingham_sentences_4$text
```

We find in these sentences Buckingham invoking "universal" in the sense of an Enlightenment mandate, whether an expression of consensus or natural laws. Democratic demand for the abolition of slavery is an expression of a "universal" sentiment (sentences 1, 3 and 4). "Universal" laws govern behavior, including the fact that rebellion is more scarce in free nations (sentence 2). Universal truths, revealed through democratic processes, give the basis for legislation, according to Buckingham.

Presented with these particular sentences, having read some of Buckingham's arguments at greater length, we may feel confident that we understand how he has used the words. As we are making a wider argument about the use of words, buttressed by several examples, we do not necessarily need to follow every single sentence back to its original context.  

```{r, message = F}
buckingham_sentences_5 <- slavery_debates_1830 %>%
  left_join(speaker_metadata_1830) %>%
  filter(speaker == "Mr. Buckingham",
         str_detect(text, "desire"))
```

```{r}
buckingham_sentences_5$text
```

Buckingham invokes "desire" as the basis for understanding. Buckingham invokes universal desire in the spirit of Locke, Mandeville, and Smith as forces that incline men to leisure and pleasure and thus incentivize work (sentences 1, 2, 3, 6, 7).  Buckingham suggests that former enslaved persons could eventually follow the American model, growing wealthy enough to become consumers who would buy finished products from British manufactures. A process of mutual enrichment would be the consequence (sentence 4). 

The sole sentence we can't understand without broader context is Sentence #5. Let's inspect the sentence to obtain the sentence ID number.

```{r}
buckingham_sentences_5[5]
```

The id of Sentence #5 is S3V0018P0_8993. Since we understand the gist of Buckingham's arguments about slavery, we might first try looking at the sentences immediately preceding this passage. The sentences are numbered chronologically, so all we have to do is to pull a few sentence numbers starting with S3V0018P0_8990.

```{r}
missing_context <- hansard_1830 %>% 
  filter(sentence_id %in% c("S3V0018P0_8990", "S3V0018P0_8991", "S3V0018P0_8992", "S3V0018P0_8993"))

missing_context$text
```

In Sentence #5, Buckingham is talking about how workers will pursue dangerous and difficult jobs when motivated by desire ("gain, honour, promotion, and prize-money.") For this reason, Buckingham concluded that "promotion was the desire of all," and that, if allowed to pursue them, the prospect of wages would incentivize formerly enslaved people as it had incentivized British navvvies to work hard in the pursuit of earnings.

### Pulling Together an Analysis

In the foregoing exercises, we have investigated many dimensions of text use in the debates over slavery. We have come up with hypotheses and tested some (if not all) of them. We have read words in context, returning to the text for more sentences when we needed more information. The material that we now have is enough to make an argument about Buckingham's use of words to make an argument about capitalism that supported the immediate abolition of slavery. 

We have applied our personal judgment in deciding when word lists are enough by themselves, when a few sentences can inform our understanding, and when we need to return to the speeches themselves for more context.  Cultivating the judgment to know when to trust data, when to look for more context, and when to leave out an example entirely is one of the most important skills of the digital historian -- and it is a skill almost never tught in departments of Comptuer Science or Data Science. Understanding which course to pursue is a matter of training, instinct, broad reading, and a willingness to engage all the tools. The interpreter who uses word count skilfully has no automatic answer for how to interpret a given speaker or given text; the top words are no sure guide, nor is tf-idf, nor the sentences linked to them. Only by knowing when to move from short sentences to longer speeches, reading the speeches in context, and examining the words thoughtfully is an adequate opinion of the text formed.  

How much of the work should I show in this case? The answer may be surprising. None of them. 

The process of testing hypothesess laid out here is considered part of the research. Most of the visualizations and discussion would not form part of a term paper, let alone a published paper. They are like the wood shavings that fill a workshop; they are evidence of the labor that has gone into making an ultimate artifact at which we aim, which is surprising knowledge about the past. At the end of the day, the shavings are swept from the workshop floor to be discarded or composted. They are not to be treasured or preserved. Just so with much of the intermediate work of reading, counting, and modeling that goes into the making of an insightful historical analysis. There is no shortcut through it. No language model gives us a substitute for thinking about words and their meaning.  

The graphs we made heretofore give us context that would otherwise be invisible. If not for text mining, we would have little idea that Buckingham and Buxton both spoke about wages disproportionately to Stanley and Peel. We might select other terms through close reading that catch our eye, and we might write about how the speakers used these words to support an argument. In any case, that is the task ahead of us — to show how speakers used their words to make a political case. But without text mining, the basis for the selection of words would be hopelessly colored by our individual prejudices. We can make a fundamentally more objective case for which words we focus on when we approach the problem through text mining.

To make an argument about Buckingham's use of words, what we need is (1) a list of the words we chose to investigate and a statement of the role that text mining played in selecting them, and (2) a close reading of the words in context that proves that we read Buckingham's speeches. 

For the purpose, we do not need to show the reader the output of our tf-idf or word count process. Instead, a list of words will suffice. In the prose, we would spend a sentence or two describing the process we went through of applying tf-idf with and without a threshold to inspect Buckingham's distinctive words when compared with four other top speakers in the debates.  If we want the list formatted nicely, we might write some code like this:

```{r}
# concatenate a list of the words I'm interested in
my_words <- c("wage", "enjoyment", "love", "universal", "desire")

# find the tfidf scores for my words by looking in previous data
my_words_w_tfidf <- tfidf_per_top_slavery_speaker_1833 %>% 
  filter(speaker == "Mr. Buckingham", word %in% my_words) %>% # find just words in my list spoken by Mr. Buckingham
  ungroup() %>% # necessary because the previous dataset was grouped
  select(word, n, tf_idf) %>% # retain three columns
  mutate(tf_idf = round(tf_idf, 4)) # round tf-idf to four decimal places

# make a table
kable(
  my_words_w_tfidf,
  format = "latex",
  booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = "Some of Mr. Buckingham's Most Distinctive Words in the Debates About Slavery"
)

```

As to the substance of the argument, we have most of the interpretive work above in the sentences that move, word by word, through a synopsis of the arguments Buckingham made about slavery, through his use of the words "desire" and "universal" to sketch out the enlightenment system of perfection that he believed made immediate abolition both inevitable and desirable, and finally through his identification of "wages" as the crucial mechanism that made it possible for men's willingness to endure dangerous work to be rewarded and thus workers to be incentivized to learn and apply themselves -- something slavery could not provide. We might cut and paste into a new series of paragraphs our piecemeal analyses above of words in context. We might reshape the resulting paragraph with topic and concluding sentences into a series of arguments supported by evidence. The resulting argument, based on the actual words of the primary text, will be -- above all -- highly persuasive, because it is composed solely of arguments and pieces of evidence, each argument corresponding to a series of pieces of evidence.  

At the risk of repetition, let us review this key point: text mining is not meant to save us from reading. It is meant to help us read better. The positive result of text mining is a precise understanding of the words used to make particular arguments by historical actors, alongside a statistical understanding of which words mark out individuals from their peers.  The best outcome of engaging in a text mining project should be judged not by the fanciness of the graph that we produce but by the seriousness with which the analyst engages original texts and their language.

To pursue a question seriously means being willing to walk into blind alleys in search of some historical surprise. The frustrating fact of our work so far is that it has not produced anything astonishing. That advocates of the abolition of slavery invoked what they believed to be the utopian aspects of capitalism as an argument has been noted by previous generations of historians. That Buckingham had a specific vocabulary with which to engage capitalism -- enjoyment, wages, the universal, and desire being its keywords -- may be a new finding, but it's hardly headline news.

The work we have performed thus far gives us the material for a 3-page paper that demonstrates competence but not insight. 

To move forward towards insight, we would want to return to our hypotheses and perform more comparisons. Whether the goal is a five- or ten-page paper or a corporate report, we will need to demonstrate that our method can discover something fundamentally new.

### Next Steps: From Competence to Insight

Fortunately, we have several hypotheses ready to hand. We could begin by testing Buckingham's use of the word "wages" against Buxton's use of the same term -- which Buxton used an astonishing 40 times in the course of the slavery debates.  Did they speak about wages in the same way? Did they make the same argument? But if our findings about wages challenge little that historians already know about utopian faith in capitalism at the beginning o the nineteenth century, this looks like an unpromising direction.  

Alternatively, we might entertain our hypotheses about the other key speakers. We might analyze the distinctive words of the other speakers -- Stanley, Peel and Wellington, whose speeches offer such a different perspective on the debates. For each subject being analyzed, we would use the same code, making minor adjustments to allow us to pull the sentences of each speaker and inspect them in greater detail. 

One place to start is Peel's invocation of the word "assembly," a word that in this context refers to the local government of the West Indies, including Jamaica.  These island assemblies were unique among the British colonies in having the kind of independence that the North American colonies desired but were denied. They had an independent legislature of their own, which had operated with relative independence since the seventeenth century. One question raised by the abolition of slavery was whether these assemblies would continue to legislate in the West Indies, and whether it might become possible for formerly enslaved people to have a vote or stand for representation in them -- that is, whether it might be possible for persons of color to control their own political destiny. 

Most of the speakers didn't use the word "assembly" or used it rarely. But for Peel, "assembly" was a distinctive word, used 11 times in 1833 alone.  

```{r, message = F}
peel_sentences <- slavery_1830 %>% # start with the text of speeches 
  left_join(speaker_metadata_1830) %>%  # merge with speaker information
  filter(speaker == "Sir Robert Peel") %>% # keep just the sentences by Peel
  filter(str_detect(text, "Assembl|assembl")) # searching for both capitalized, uncapitalized, singular and plural
```

```{r}
peel_sentences$text # show us the text of Peel's sentences
```

Here again we must read the sentences in their original speeches to make sense of it. 

```{r, message = F}
# moving from a list of sentences to the full speeches for context
peel_speech_ids <- peel_sentences %>% 
  select(sentence_id) %>%
  left_join(file_metadata_1830) %>% # merge with metadata for the 1830s
  select(speech_id)

peel_speeches <- peel_speech_ids %>%
  left_join(file_metadata_1830) %>%
  select(sentence_id, speech_id) %>%
  left_join(hansard_1830) %>% # merge those columns with the text of the speeches 
  left_join(speaker_metadata_1830) %>%
  select(speaker, text, speech_id, speechdate) %>% # choose just the columns with speech, text, and speech_id numbers
  group_by(speech_id, speaker, speechdate) %>% # within each speech, paste together each sentence, back to back, with a space in between. Retain the name of the speaker
    reframe(speech = paste0(text, collapse = " ")) %>% #paste0(text, " ", text), speaker) %>%
    ungroup() %>%
  mutate(speech = paste0(speechdate, ": ", toupper(speaker), " ", speech)) %>%
  select(speech) # retain just the column with the speaker's name and full speech of each text

# some fancy code to turn it into a table
kable(peel_speeches, format = "html", col.names = "", caption = "Three Speeches by Buckingham about Slavery That Invoke the Word 'Wages'") %>% 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))

head(buckingham_sentences)
```

In the three speeches above, we find Peel invoking the colonial assemblies of the West Indies in order to defend the principle of independent democracies being entitled to make their own laws, unhindered by empire -- even when the laws contained principles so odious as that of the enslavement of human beings. 

In the first speech, April 15, 1833, Peel noted his dissatisfaction with the Colonial Assemblies but urged moderation and warned against making hasty resolutions that could harm the interests of slaves, humanity, and planters.

In the second speech, May 24, 1833, Peel pointed out the danger of making hasty regulations from afar without understanding the local conditions in the West Indies, especially in light of recent insurrections in Jamaica. He warned against inciting slaves to resistance through "incautious language and false hopes," only to then suppress them with military force, which would be unjust and exacerbate the situation.

Cautioning against haste, Peel invoked the assemblies, suggesting that it was a desire to "triumph over" the planters in their assemblies that made advocates of abolition impatient. Against haste, he advised a slow and deliberate plan to ensure order -- the plan for apprenticeships, which would continue slavery under another name for seven further years.  

In the third speech, June 3, 1833, Peel again urged his listeners not to interfere in the affairs of colonial assemblies, "but to lay the foundation of future prosperity and tranquillity in those countries." 

He raised questions about whether slaves were "fit for freedom." The crowning point in Peel's argument was a lesson about history. Peel shocked his listeners by alluding to the liberation of the slaves in the French colony of St. Domingo in 1794, which had been followed riots which Peel described as "atrocities," which resulted in the leveling of inhabitations and the enslavement of whites by black pirates. In his account, Peel argued that the violence was levied against white bodies by black ones, and that the same specter of black violence awaited Englishmen in the West Indies if they moved towards liberation too quickly. 

The existence of slavery thus became the basis for arguing that the West Indies could have no possible future as an independent government:

>"When a state of slavery is that upon which we are to work, the very means which lead to liberty must partake of compulsion. The minds of men being crippled with that restraint, can do nothing for themselves; every thing must be done for them. The regulations can owe little to consent."


When we compare Buckingham's arguments about the "universal" with Peel's arguments about "assembly," what we see is a standoff between two versions of the enlightenment, both full of faith for hope in humanity and the power of reason, but which worked against each other in a dramatic standoff.

The first version -- Buckingham's -- defined freedom in economic terms. It found slavery abhorrent and declared that it must be immediately desired. Buckingham's contention that the laws of unfreedom, once righted, would turned former slaves into productive subjects was premised upon faith in the laws of the free market and the ordered workings of desire, which envisioned formerly enslaved persons becoming free and going on to pursue dangerous and rewarding work alongside the British working class.

The second version -- Peel's -- defined freedom as the ability of educated individuals to elect their own leaders. It defined the basis for democracy as sacroscanct. At the same time, it held up a standard for being fit to govern. Only educated, peaceful people could be allowed to elect their leaders. This bar to entry -- the defining of the conditions under which liberal individuals would be fit to govern -- was one of the major points that would delimit democracy for most of the nineteenth and twentieth-century experiments with democracy. Again and again, points of this kind would be invoked to artificially limit the freedoms of individuals (like the enslaved inhabitants of the West Indies). And the argument was composed of a slight-of-hand: on the one hand, the endorsement of democracy (and the colonial assembles) as sacrosanct places of law-making whose powers must not be challenged by an imperial authority. On the other hand, the fear of unruly individuals, driven by race-based terror, backed by anecdotes about black pirates. The upshot of this argument was the denial that formerly enslaved persons could be educated for granted independence, who looked to the coercive power of parliament alone for saftey. 

Both Buckingham's and Peel's arguments about freedom were premised on rationality, humanity, and the idea that the duty of parliament was to promote peace around the world.  But it was the latter -- the argument that democracy could only succeed where coercion was applied to keep unruly forces at bay -- that won the day.  

Here, at last, an argument wider than mere personality, rhetoric, or affectation is starting to emerge. It is likely that if we pursued further looking into the top speakers and their favored words, we would be able to identify still further complcations and aspects of the enlightenment's encounter with slavery in 1833. The process would be the same as it was above: using code to move from words to sentences and sentences to their context, then reading, summarizing, and interpreting how words were shaped by speakers into arguments and positions that encapsulate the differences of world view at work in 1833 and the terrible consequences that flowed from the failures of that moment. 

What makes this versikon of the argument "insightful". in comparison to the others? Put simply, an argument should reflect back on all possible levels of analysis -- from the individual in their context to the global, political, and economic dimensions of the historical debate. We turn to historical analysis, as Quentin Skinner puts it, to act "as a kind of archaeologist, bringing buried intellectual treasure back to the surface, dusting it down and enabling us to consider what we think of it." (Skinner, Liberty Before Liberalism (1998), p. 112). In order to have an informed opinion about the positions of Buckingham and Peel around slavery -- and therefore in order to assess the ways in which the liberties of enslaved persons were postponed again and again -- it is useful to have statistical insights into the keywords "universal" and "assemblies" upon which Buckingham and Peel staked their claims about freedom. We have not done the work when we arrive at lists of keywords, however. The keywords must be read and understood in context. The arguments must be summarized. Their implications must be considered. Above all, we must strive to grasp at an explanation that helps us to understand why the abolition of slavery was so politically difficult for the seemingly-well intentioned men who gathered in Westminster in 1833 -- and what we can learn about reasoned claims about government from that date. If the keywords do not unlock some insights about that moment, they do us no good.

The claim of this book has been that the application of historical reasoning with text mining is useful not only for professional studies of history but also for the many applied areas where understanding the reaction to some crisis is useful -- a theme imprtant in business management, journalism, and politics. The crisis we wish to interpret when text mining corporate reports or journalistic stories might not be the postponed abolition of slavery in British Empire. But it will still be useful for us to understand the significance of individual points of view -- for instance, memos written by separate executives or originating in different wings of the government -- and how they instrumentalize particular keywords as anchors for broader concepts, be those concepts "freedom" and "slavery" or "earnings" and "employment."  

### Did the Concept of "Freedom" Change After the Debates of 1833?

The reason why the top speakers in any debate matter is the hypothesis that their words may have changed the minds of many listeners. Spoken aloud before an audience of other members of the press, reprinted in the magazines and newspapers of the nation, the words spoken in parliament mattered. 

We can ask this question two ways: first, by asking about the debates around slavery before and after 1833, and secondly by asking the same question about all of Hansard for the same dates.

```{r}
slavery_debates_before_1833 <- slavery_1830 %>% 
  filter(year < 1833) 

freedom_collocates_before_1833 <- slavery_debates_before_1833 %>%
  mutate(when = "1830-32") %>%
  filter(str_detect(tolower(text), "labour")) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
 # anti_join(stop_words) %>%
 # anti_join(custom_stop_words) %>%
 group_by(when, word) %>%
  reframe(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) 

top_freedom_collocates_before_1833 <- freedom_collocates_before_1833 %>%
  top_n(30) 

top_freedom_collocates_before_1833
```

```{r}
slavery_debates_after_1833 <- slavery_1830 %>% 
  filter(year > 1833) 

freedom_collocates_after_1833 <- slavery_debates_after_1833 %>%
  mutate(when = "1834-36") %>%
  filter(str_detect(tolower(text), "free")) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
 # anti_join(stop_words) %>%
 # anti_join(custom_stop_words) %>%
 group_by(when, word) %>%
  reframe(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) 

top_freedom_collocates_after_1833 <- freedom_collocates_before_1833 %>%
  top_n(30) 

top_freedom_collocates_after_1833
```

Let's use tf-idf to find the words that are most distinctive of each period -- before and after 1833 -- in the debates about slavery.

```{r}


freedom_collocates_before_1833 <- slavery_debates_before_1833 %>%
  mutate(when = "1830-32") %>%
  filter(str_detect(tolower(text), "free")) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
 # anti_join(stop_words) %>% 
 # anti_join(custom_stop_words) %>%
 group_by(when, word) %>%
  reframe(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) 


freedom_collocates_after_1833 <- slavery_debates_after_1833 %>%
  mutate(when = "1834-36") %>%
  filter(str_detect(tolower(text), "free")) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
 # anti_join(stop_words) %>%
 # anti_join(custom_stop_words) %>%
 group_by(when, word) %>%
  reframe(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) 


tf_idf_freedom_collocates <- bind_rows(freedom_collocates_after_1833, freedom_collocates_before_1833) %>%
  bind_tf_idf(word, when, n) %>%
  arrange(-tf_idf) %>%
  select(when, word, n, tf_idf)

tf_idf_freedom_collocates_before <- tf_idf_freedom_collocates %>%
  filter(when == "1830-32") %>%
  select(-when) %>%
  top_n(15)

tf_idf_freedom_collocates_after <- tf_idf_freedom_collocates %>%
  filter(when == "1834-36") %>%
  select(-when) %>%
  top_n(15)
```

```{r}
kable(tf_idf_freedom_collocates_before, caption = "1830-32")
```

```{r}
kable(tf_idf_freedom_collocates_after, caption = "1834-36")
```

Let's look to see if freedom's meaning changed across everything.

```{r}
hansard_before_1833 <- hansard_1830 %>% 
  filter(year < 1833) %>%
  bind_rows(hansard_1820)

hansard_after_1833 <- hansard_1830 %>%
  filter(year > 1833)

freedom_collocates_before_1833 <- hansard_before_1833 %>%
  mutate(when = "before 1833") %>%
  filter(str_detect(tolower(text), "freedom")) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
 # anti_join(stop_words) %>% 
 # anti_join(custom_stop_words) %>%
 group_by(when, word) %>%
  reframe(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) 


freedom_collocates_after_1833 <- hansard_after_1833 %>%
  mutate(when = "after 1833") %>%
  filter(str_detect(tolower(text), "freedom")) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
 # anti_join(stop_words) %>%
 # anti_join(custom_stop_words) %>%
 group_by(when, word) %>%
  reframe(n = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) 


tf_idf_freedom_collocates <- bind_rows(freedom_collocates_after_1833, freedom_collocates_before_1833) %>%
  bind_tf_idf(word, when, n) %>%
  arrange(-tf_idf) %>%
  select(when, word, n, tf_idf)

tf_idf_freedom_collocates_before <- tf_idf_freedom_collocates %>%
  filter(when == "before 1833") %>%
  select(-when) %>%
  #filter(n>5) %>%
  top_n(15, wt = tf_idf)

tf_idf_freedom_collocates_after <- tf_idf_freedom_collocates %>%
  filter(when == "after 1833") %>%
  select(-when) %>%
  #filter(n>10) %>%
  top_n(15, wt = tf_idf)
```

```{r}
kable(tf_idf_freedom_collocates_before, caption = "1820-32")
```

```{r}
kable(tf_idf_freedom_collocates_after, caption = "1834-39")
```

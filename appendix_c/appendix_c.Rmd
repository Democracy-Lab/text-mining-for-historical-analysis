## Troubleshooting Code with Chatbots

Chatbots like ChatGPT are now commonly used to troubleshoot and debug code, often replacing traditional approaches to scanning and interpreting documentation. However, while they can recognize patterns, they do not know our exact intentions. If our problem looks similar to another issue, is uncommon and poorly represented in the chatbot's training data, or arises from a new use case, the chatbot may misinterpret our problem or offer a solution meant for a different situation. 

The following section introduces a repeatable troubleshooting cycle designed specifically for working with code. In doing so, it provides some context for how chatbots process information that way we can anticipate where misalignments might occur and correct them. The goal is to make interactions with a chatbot more predictable and productive by structuring the conversation: clearly stating the task, providing minimal reproducible code and screenshots of the data, showing the exact error, asking a focused question, testing the suggestions locally, and iterating until the issue resolves. This cyclical workflow helps minimize the gap between what we might intend and what the chatbot thinks we are asking, turning the debugging process into a human-guided loop.

## A Troubleshooting Cycle for Working with ChatGPT

1. Describe the Task

What are we hoping to achieve? Provide a description in plain language
(“I am trying to extract bigrams from 1850 Hansard debates…”)
The expected type of output (“…and return a dataframe with bigram counts per speaker.”)

This helps to not just perform the task, extracting bigrams, which could result in many different paths. While most things in R are in dataframes, in another language bigrams could be given back in a different format. 


2. Provide the Minimal Code

If possible, aim for a small example—a few lines only:

Include the function or chunk generating the error.

Exclude unrelated steps.

This helps ChatGPT reason accurately and prevents “hallucinated” fixes.

Sometimes provide it with a script or dataset, however, this can exceed the chatbot's memory, causing ___ 


3. Provide a Screenshot or Snippet of the Dataset 



4. Provide the Exact Error Message

Copy-paste error output verbatim, including:

The first line (most important)

Any traceback shown

This helps ChatGPT see what the interpreter saw.

5. Ask a Specific Question

Examples:

“Why is this object not being found?”

“Is this a many-to-many join?”

“Why is spacyr failing to initialize?”

“How do I get this to run in PDF LaTeX?”

Precise questions lead to precise help.

5. Receive the Explanation, Try the Fix

ChatGPT will:

Propose a diagnosis

Provide corrected code

Explain why the issue happened

Run the suggestion in your environment (RStudio, Jupyter, Terminal).

Don’t skip this. Your environment is the source of truth.

6. Iterate

This cycle repeats:

New error → new snippet → new explanation → new test

Iteration is normal, especially when:

Working with large humanities corpora

Using complex libraries (tidytext, quanteda, spaCy, ggplot, plotly)

Moving across environments (Windows/Mac/Linux, HPC clusters)

Working with multimodal pipelines (e.g., OCR → parsing → tokenization → modeling)

Troubleshooting becomes a collaborative conversation, not a one-off question.

8. Consolidate the Working Solution

Once it works:

Ask ChatGPT to rewrite the code cleanly

Add comments

Make it reusable (turn into a function)

This step turns messy debugging into a stable tool you can use later or teach to others.

9. Reflect on the Pattern

Ask:

“What was the underlying cause of this error?”

“How can I avoid this in future?”

“What’s the general principle here?”

This helps build technical literacy rather than dependency.

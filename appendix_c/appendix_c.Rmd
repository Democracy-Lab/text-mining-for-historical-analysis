## Restarting R Before Installing a Package



When R asks you to restart before installing a package

Sometimes, when installing a new package (especially one that depends on system libraries, compiles code, or updates an existing package currently in use), RStudio may show a prompt such as:

“A restart of R is required to complete this install.”

This simply means that R needs a fresh session so the package can be installed without conflicts from packages already loaded.

What to do:

Save your work (any scripts or documents you are editing).

Click “Yes” or “Restart R” when prompted.

RStudio will restart the session (you may see the Console clear).

Re-run the install.packages("package_name") command after the restart if it did not complete automatically.

Once installed, load the package using library(package_name).

Why this happens:
R cannot overwrite a package that is currently loaded into memory. Restarting ensures the old version is unloaded so the new version can be installed cleanly.

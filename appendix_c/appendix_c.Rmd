## Troubleshooting Code with Chatbots

Chatbots are by now an established way of troubleshooting code and debugging, sometimes taking the role of documentation. 

ChatGPT does not know you intention 
so if your problem looks liek somethign else, it might misunderstand / represent 









A Troubleshooting Cycle for Working with ChatGPT

A Repeatable Workflow for Digital Humanists

This cycle helps structure your interactions with ChatGPT so you can move from confusion → clarity → working code → reflection.

1. Describe the Task

What are you trying to do?
Provide:

The goal in plain language (“I am trying to extract bigrams from 1850 Hansard debates…”)

The expected type of output (“…and return a dataframe with word counts per speaker.”)

This keeps both you and ChatGPT anchored in the research objective.

2. Provide the Minimal Code

Aim for the smallest possible example—a few lines only:

Include the function or chunk generating the error.

Exclude unrelated steps.

This helps ChatGPT reason accurately and prevents “hallucinated” fixes.

3. Provide the Exact Error Message

Copy-paste error output verbatim, including:

The first line (most important)

Any traceback shown

This helps ChatGPT see what the interpreter saw.

4. Ask a Specific Question

Examples:

“Why is this object not being found?”

“Is this a many-to-many join?”

“Why is spacyr failing to initialize?”

“How do I get this to run in PDF LaTeX?”

Precise questions lead to precise help.

5. Receive the Explanation, Try the Fix

ChatGPT will:

Propose a diagnosis

Provide corrected code

Explain why the issue happened

Run the suggestion in your environment (RStudio, Jupyter, Terminal).

Don’t skip this. Your environment is the source of truth.

6. Report Back the New Behavior

If it works:

Say “that fixed it”
If it fails:

Paste the new error

Paste the changed code

You are not “starting over”; you’re moving to the next loop of the cycle with more information.

7. Iterate

This cycle repeats:

New error → new snippet → new explanation → new test

Iteration is normal, especially when:

Working with large humanities corpora

Using complex libraries (tidytext, quanteda, spaCy, ggplot, plotly)

Moving across environments (Windows/Mac/Linux, HPC clusters)

Working with multimodal pipelines (e.g., OCR → parsing → tokenization → modeling)

Troubleshooting becomes a collaborative conversation, not a one-off question.

8. Consolidate the Working Solution

Once it works:

Ask ChatGPT to rewrite the code cleanly

Add comments

Make it reusable (turn into a function)

This step turns messy debugging into a stable tool you can use later or teach to others.

9. Reflect on the Pattern

Ask:

“What was the underlying cause of this error?”

“How can I avoid this in future?”

“What’s the general principle here?”

This helps build technical literacy rather than dependency.
